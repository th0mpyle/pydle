# Pydle

A Wordle copycat using just the Python command line. Planning to fork this and add a GUI in the distant future when I'm less busy.

You can clone this and get started - I know nobody's seeing this but issues and even pull requests would be very appreciated!

# Repl

The Repl can be found here so you can run the game in your browser.

However, Replit is slow and won't be updated as often as this repo, so if you want to check this out I recommend that you download the ZIP or clone it.

That being said, please check it out! https://replit.com/@th0mpyle/pydle?v=1
